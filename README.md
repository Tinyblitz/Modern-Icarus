# Modern-Icarus

// An interactive reimagining of the story of Icarus with branching endings (3 in total). The story autoplays but text can be skipped over.  Text pulled from various poems relating to the story of Icarus.

// The ending you get is determined during the flying portion of the story.  Essentially a morality meter that fills up based on what words you choose to answer the corresponding questions.

// This project uses P5js libraries and requires you to run it on a local server or go to https://editor.p5js.org/DanielTsiu/full/v5R6U3ag5 to view the project from the P5js editor.
